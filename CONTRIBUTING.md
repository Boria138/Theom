## Project overview

- `src/` folder contains the source code of theom.
- `src/bin` contains the binaries that theom require to run.
- `src/share` is where theom (configs/scripts/themes) and theom xsession folders are located.
- `src/share/theom` contains the theom configs, scripts, themes etc.
- `src/share/xsession` contains the xsession that shows theom on the greeter.
- `src/share/theom/config` contains all the configs of theom.

## Using scripts

- run `./gen_man.sh` if you updated the manual to generate the manual in `/src/share/man/`
- run `./update_deps_txt.sh` if you updated the PKGBUILD to change the dependencies
- run `./update_version.sh <version_num>` to upgrade the theom version on all required files.

**Usage example**:

```bash
# After updating the theom manual
./gen_man.sh # Run this in the root of the project

# After updating the theom dependencies
./update_deps_txt.sh # Run this in the root of the project

# When upgrading theom version. (eg: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
./update_version.sh 1.0.1 # Run this in the root of the project
```
