# Templates

This directory contains the templates of theom/theom tools configuration.
It is not recommended to edit any of the files provided here if you are a casual user.

This directory is only intented for copying.

**Copying example:**

```bash
# This sets your theom configuration to the minimal template
cp /usr/share/theom/templates/config.toml.d/minimal ~/.config/theom/config.toml

# The other templates available in config.toml.d are `dev` and `casual`
# The casual is the template with most fancy configuration.
```

If you just want to set the theom configuration to the default one, then you may run the following command:

```bash
# This sets the theom configuration file to the default one.
cp /usr/share/theom/config/theom/config.toml ~/.config/theom/config.toml
```
