# Widgets

Widgets are super important in making theom pretty. Theom uses [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) for displaying the widgets.

## How to add new widgets

You can add new widgets to theom by added new files in this folder (~/.config/widgets/). To show the widgets on the screen, you should add the path to all widgets in the **show** key that is under the **widgets** table.

## Credits

These widgets are inspired by the widgets from [sleex](https://github.com/AxOS-project/Sleex)
