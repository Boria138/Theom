# Changelog

All notable changes to **Theom** will be documented in this file.

> This project follows a loose [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and uses [GitHub releases](https://github.com/axos-project/theom/releases) as the primary source.

---

## [3.1.0] - ADD DATE HERE

### Added

- Default configuration for **rofi**, **alacritty**, and **dunst**.
- `update-theom-appconfs` binary which would set the default configuration of **rofi**, **alacritty**, and **dunst**.

### Fixed

- eww launch script to prevent eww glitches that has been bothering us since `v0.5.6`.
- eww bar volume control glitches.

### Changed

- `tcomp-gen` to consider perfromance mode as the default mode.
- `tosd` launch scripts to have better UI (User Interface).

### Notes and Information

- With this update, `tosd` is not deprecated anymore.
- The default configuration added to **rofi**, **alacritty**, and **dunst** will help them find a configuration file. Previously, theom used directories named **light** and **dark**. Due to this, only theom could assign the applications to those configuration instead of the applications finding it themselves. The new `update-theom-appconfs` binary will people set their default configuration which the applications can find by themselves.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed

- Invisible eww bar bug.

### Removed

- migrate_file which checked if we had to migrate or not.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-13

### Added

- `--list-logs` flag to `theom` command.
- New wallpapers.
- `tcomp-gen` - a tool that generates compositor configuration files.
- Multiple animation support (none, basic, fancy).
- **--migrate** flag to `theom-setup`
- Outdated version popup warning which provides the user an option to migrate.
- **migrate_config** file in `/usr/share/theom/` that would define whether user should migrate to a newer configuration.

### Changed

- Default wallpaper. `aesthetic_deer` changed to `mountains.jpg`.
- `theom` binary to include `tcomp-gen` as a new core binary.
- Logout popup to say **theom** instead of **i3**.

### Fixed

- `tscdScript` to create `~/.local/state/theom` correctly.
- `tscdctl` printing unnecessary information in stdout.
- `theom-setup` which copied exec_always autostart to the wrong directory.

### Reworked

- Theom compositor (picom) structure to be flexible.

### Notes and Information

> This is a new major release of theom.
> This major version reconfigures the structure of theom's compositor (picom) configuration, and provides a better user experience with the compositor.
> Theom now relys on `tcomp-gen` binary which would generate the static configuration file based on multiple smaller snippets of .json files.

> Theom now also has a popup warning that users can use to easily migrate their configuration to the latest without even losing their customization!
> Theom automatically inserts the new changes that doesn't exist on your current configuration during the migration without touching any other modifications. To migrate via the terminal, users can run `theom-config --migrate` instead of having to reboot to get the popup warning that asks to migrate.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-09

### Added

- `i3status` to optional dependencies.
- Basic lock screen.

### Changed

## [2.1.0] - 2025-06-30

### Added

- `extra_config.conf` where users can add extra WM configuration. Path to `extra_config.conf` is `~/.config/theom/.win/extra_config.conf`.
- Logging support for `theom-setup` for better error debugging. `theom-setup` logs are stored at `~/.local/state/theom/logs/setup.logs`.
- Logging support for `start-picom.sh` for debugging the compositor. Log path: `~/.local/state/theom/logs/compositor.logs`
- Logging support for `show-widgets.sh` for debugging conky widgets. Log path: `~/.local/state/theom/logs/show-widgets.sh`

### Changed

- Path to osd snippets. (~/.config/theom/osd-snippets -> ~/.config/theom/.osd-snippets).
- `THEOM_SYSTEM` path. (~/.config/THEOM_SYSTEM/ -> ~/.local/state/theom/).

### Fixed

### Added

- `--checkup`, `-c` argument for theom-config.

- `tcheatsheet` application so that users can use it to see default `theom keybindings`.
- New default keybinding for `tcheatsheet` (Super+f1).

### Changed

- `theom-setup` so that it wont output the logs of `tscdScript`.
- Changed wallpaper path (`/usr/share/backgrounds/` -> `/usr/share/backgrounds/theom`).
- `theom-welcome` so that it relies on `theom-config` for getting/setting values in theom configuration.
- Path to theom widgets (`~/.config/widgets/` -> `~/.config/theom/twidgets/`)

### Fixed

- `show-widgets.sh` script which is responsible for showing widgets on the screen.
- Config directory path in `theom` script (dry run).
- Window manager to use new path.

### Removed

- `Enable on screen display effects` option from theom greeter.
- All reference to previous config path (`~/.config/.theom/`) in all `theom-packages`.

### Credits

- Thank's to [@ardox](https://github.com/levraiardox) for giving me the permission to use wallpapers from [axos wallpaper collection](https://github.com/AxOS-project/wallpapers) which helped me by a ton.

### Reasons and Pledges

> With T2 (Theom 2.0), I pledge to:
>
> - Follow [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/) precisely.
> - Ensure that major breaking changes only occur in major versions (e.g., 3.x, 4.x).
> - Test every release for usability and configuration stability before public rollout.
> - Handle all future breaking configuration or widget path changes via automated migration tools.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-06-22

### Changed

- Default wallpaper (dunes-sun -> aesthetic_deer)

### Fixed

- Broken scripts (scripts broken by 1.2.0 `theom-config` change)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-22

### Added

- Better starship theme for terminal.

### Changed

- Theom packages (settings & dashboard) to be sleek, modern and fast.
- Theom config directory path.

### Fixed

- Theom packages so that they can rely on `theom-config` for setting/getting values.

> [!CAUTION]
> This version of theom is broken due to the core scripts not being upto date with `theom-config`
> It is recommended to install the 1.2.1 version as it addressed the broken scripts.

---

> ⚠️ Note on Package Compatibility:
> Earlier versions of Theom (prior to 1.2.0) followed a bad configuration path.
> Previously, the configuration directory had a leading `.` in the `~/.config` directory.
> Directories with leading `.` are not supposed to be used in `~/.config`, as stated by XDG.
> So, starting from version 1.2.0, theom packages will now follow the new path (`~/.config/theom`) to function.
> If you use a version prior to 1.2.0, theom packages such as the settings, dashboard etc. will stop functioning as intended.
> If you are fine with that, then the core desktop environment will still work fine but at the cost of losing the official GUI applications of theom.
> This wont happen again since all theom packages have updated and they now rely on `theom-config` directly to set/get values.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-18

### Added

- Autostarts (`~/.config/.theom-autostarts/exec_once.sh` & `~/.config/.theom-autostarts/exec_always.sh`) to make theom more customisable.
- Scripts oriented to improving user experience (`~/.config/.theom/user_scripts/`).
- Theom control (Currently only used to add/list autostarts).

### Fixed

- gvfs not installed on system.

### Removed

- Alacritty (default terminal) dark theme transparency.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-16

### Fixed

- Eww calendar not opening
