# Changelog

All notable changes to **Theom** will be documented in this file.

> This project follows a loose [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and uses [GitHub releases](https://github.com/axos-project/theom/releases) as the primary source.

> ⚠️ Note on Version History:
> Earlier versions of Theom (prior to 0.6.0) followed an informal versioning scheme.
> Releases were made when significant updates were ready, not necessarily in sequence.
> As such, some version numbers (e.g., 0.2, 0.3) were skipped or never publicly released.
> Starting from version 0.6.0, versioning has become more consistent.
